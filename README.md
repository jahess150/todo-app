# React Todo List App

A simple and intuitive todo list application built with React. This project is designed for practicing and learning the basics of React, including state management, component-based architecture, and event handling.

## Features

- Add tasks to your to-do list.
- Mark tasks as completed or uncompleted.
- Tasks are dynamically rendered using React components.
- Simple and responsive UI.

- **`public/`**: Contains the HTML template and other static assets.
- **`src/`**: Contains the React components and main application logic.
- **`components/`**: Contains reusable components for the todo list.

## How It Works

The app is structured around three main components:

1. **`App.js`**: The root component that manages the state and renders the other components.
2. **`AddTodo.js`**: A component that handles the input and submission of new tasks.
3. **`TodoList.js`**: A component that renders the list of tasks using individual `TodoItem` components.

The `useState` hook is used for managing the list of tasks and their completion status. The tasks are passed down as props from `App.js` to the child components.
